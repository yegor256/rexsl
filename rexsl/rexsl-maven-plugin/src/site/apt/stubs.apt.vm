How to add extra functionality during tests?

  For example, you want to test your application's behavior when
  some unexpected runtime exception is happening. You need to inject
  a special block of code into your application during tests that will
  throw such an exception, and your test scripts will validate application
  behavior. We can do it with test stubs located together with your test
  classes:

+--
/foo
  pom.xml
  /src
    /main
    /test
      /java
        /foo
          HomeTest.java
          RuntimeExceptionStub.java
      /rexsl
        /scripts
          WhatIfRuntimeException.groovy
+--

  This is how <<<RuntimeExceptionStub.java>> may look like:

+--
package foo;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
@Path("/runtime-exception")
public class RuntimeExceptionStub {
  @GET
  public String throwIt() {
    throw new IllegalStateException("hello, world!");
  }
}
+--

  This is how we may test it from <<<WhatIfRuntimeException.groovy>>>:

+--
import com.rexsl.test.TestClient
import org.junit.Assert
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*
def r = new TestClient(rexsl.home)
    .get('/runtime-exception')
Assert.assertThat(r.status, equalTo(500))
+--

  The test should pass, and may be extended with additional validations. We
  may check what exactly is returned, how this page is formatted, etc. The
  same way as you check regular pages/responses.
