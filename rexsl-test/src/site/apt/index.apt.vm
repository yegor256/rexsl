RESTful Java Client

  The module contains a collection of usable tools for testing of
  ReXSL-powered application (or any other RESTful server).
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/rexsl/test/RestTester.html}<<<RestTester>>>}}
  is a RESTful Java client with a fluent interface:

+--
public class Main {
  public void main() {
    String body = RestTester.start("http://www.rexsl.com")
      .header(HttpHeaders.USER_AGENT, "Safari 4")
      .header(HttpHeaders.ACCEPT, MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
      .get("reading front page of ReXSL.com")
      .assertStatus(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK)
      .assertBody(Matchers.containsString("ReXSL"))
      .assertXPath("//xhtml:body")
      .getBody();
  }
}
+--

  The beauty of this RESTful Java client (comparing to others) is that it
  retrieves data and makes test assertions at the same time. Your integration
  tests will automatically validate your RESTful client
  against the contract (API) of the server.

  Other important classes in this module:

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/rexsl/test/JaxbConverter.html}<<<JaxbConverter>>>}}
     - convenient JAXB-to-XML converter

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/rexsl/test/SimpleXml.html}<<<SimpleXml>>>}}
     - simple object-oriented XML parser

  Include this dependency into your project (or download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/rexsl/rexsl-test/${project.version}/rexsl-test-${project.version}.jar}rexsl-test-${project.version}.jar}}
  and add to classpath):
