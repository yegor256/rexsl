 * classes, for example:
 *
 * <pre> &#64;Inset.Default({ LinksInset.class, FlashInset.class })
 * public class BaseRs extends BaseResource {
 *   &#64;Inset.Runtime
 *   public Inset ver() {
 *     return new VersionInset("1.0", "", "13-Mar-2013");

 *       &#64;Override
 *       public void render(final BasePage&lt;?, ?&gt; page,
 *         final Response.ResponseBuilder builder) {
 *         builder.type(MediaType.TEXT_XML);
 *         builder.header(HttpHeaders.VARY, "Cookie");
 *     }
 *   };
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>For every new page methods {@code version()} and {@code supplementary()}
 * will be called. Returned insets will be used to help in page rendering.
 * Their {@code render(BasePage,Response.ResponseBuilder)} methods will be
 * used to extend the JAXB page and the JAX-RS response.
